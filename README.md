# Calculating-Mean-Median-and-Mode-of-a-given-list-of-numbers
Using this code we can calculate the mean, median and mode of a given list of numbers in a python list.
In many statistical analysis with numbers, we very often need to calculate the mean, median, mode etc. of a given set of numbers.
For exaple in a class of some students we often need to calculate the above mentioned quantities for the obtained marks of all students in an exam.
In these cases this basic and easy python code may be a very helpful one.
First of all we have to store our numbers in the list called 'given_list'. Then the code automatically returns the output with the mean value, median value and the mode value for the given list of numbers.
